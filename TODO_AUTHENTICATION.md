  - [x] Set secure HTTP-only cookies
- [x] Implement /api/v1/signin endpoint
  - [x] Validate credentials
  - [x] Generate JWT tokens
  - [x] Set secure HTTP-only cookies

- [x] Create SignIn form component with show/hide password
- [x] Create auth layout/routing with mode switching
- [x] Add form validation with Zod schemas (field-level validation)
- [x] Handle auth state management with automatic token refresh
- [x] Add protected route component
- [x] Install required UI dependencies (shadcn/ui components, Lucide React icons)
- [x] Create main app dashboard placeholder
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS integration
- [x] Implement complete theme system (light/dark/system with detection)
- [x] Fix Cloudflare Pages Functions development setup
- [x] Verify API proxy and middleware protection (returns proper 401)
- [x] Implement React Router with proper URL navigation (/auth, /dashboard)
- [x] Fix authentication persistence on page refresh with proper cookie settings
- [x] Eliminate theme flash (FOIT) with critical CSS and blocking script
- [x] Add automatic navigation between auth and dashboard routes
- [x] Configure development environment with proper JWT secrets

## Phase 5: Testing ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Unit tests for JWT utilities
- [x] Unit tests for password utilities  
- [x] Unit tests for auth schemas validation
- [x] Integration tests for auth endpoints (signup, signin, me, refresh, signout)
- [x] Complete authentication flow integration tests
- [x] Test coverage report showing 100% coverage for auth utilities and endpoints
- [ ] Frontend component tests (optional - complex React testing setup required)
- [ ] E2E authentication flow tests (optional - requires full deployment setup)

## Phase 6: Security & Best Practices ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints (5 signin/15min, 3 signup/hour, 10 refresh/5min)
- [x] Add CSRF protection with HMAC-signed tokens and timestamp validation
- [x] Secure cookie configuration with httpOnly, sameSite, and production-ready settings
- [x] Input sanitization for XSS prevention and username normalization
- [x] Error handling without information leakage (constant error messages, timing attack protection)
- [x] Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [x] Suspicious activity detection (SQL injection, XSS attempts, bot detection)
- [x] Comprehensive security event logging with IP tracking
- [x] Timing attack prevention in authentication flows

## Technical Requirements
- JWT with access token (15min) + refresh token (7 days)
- HTTP-only, secure, SameSite cookies
- Password hashing with bcrypt/argon2
- Username-based KV storage
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type-safe API responses
